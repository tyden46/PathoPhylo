# PathoPhylo
#### PathoPhylo is a work-in-progress module to take .tsv files generated by [Pathoscope](https://github.com/PathoScope/PathoScope) and generate taxonomy and abundance files across all samples 
## Setting Up PathoPhylo
### To set up PathoPhylo do the following:
#### 1. Clone this git repository ie `git clone https://github.com/tyden46/PathoPhylo.git`
#### 2. Navigate to the getPhylo folder by running `cd PathoPhylo/getPhylo`
#### 3. Generate libraries by executing `bash MakeLibraries.sh`
## Running PathoPhylo
### Requirements:
#### PathoPhylo requires at least 1 .tsv file from a pathoscope output. These files should be located in the same directory as the `run.sh` script. Example files are in the `getPhylo/input`
### Command Line Arguments
#### PathoPhylo is run using the command `bash run.sh {MINIMUM_SUM_ABUNDANCE_VALUE}` where MINIMUM_SUM_ABUNDANCE_VALUE is a value greater than 0 that represents the minimum summed relative abundance for a genome that you want to consider. This is implemented because Pathoscope will often detect tens of thousands of genomes across samples. Establishing a minimum value of, say, 0.01, will reduce the total number of genomes and significantly improve runtime. If you do not want to set a minimum filter, simply supply a MINIMUM_SUM_ABUNDANCE_VALUE of 0.
### Demo
#### You can run a demo by moving demo input folders to the current directory ie `mv input/* .` and then executing the command `bash run.sh 0.01`
### Output
#### A file called `CombinedTable.txt` will be created that contains the relative abundance values across samples for the genomes that passed the MINIMUM_SUM_ABUNDANCE_VALUE threshold.
#### A file called `LineageTable.txt` will be created that contains the taxonomic lineage for each the genomes that passed the MINIMUM_SUM_ABUNDANCE_VALUE threshold.
